"""Install every release this package's pins claim, and run the suite on each.

A version range is a claim about every release inside it. This package declares
two -- `presence-audit` as a hard dependency and `arbiter-engine` under the
`detect` extra -- and no suite can check either, because a suite runs against the
one release the resolver picked. By default that is the newest, which is the
release the claim is least likely to be wrong about. The floor is the interesting
end and it is the end nothing exercises.

So each in-range release goes into its own throwaway environment with this
package installed beside it, and the suite runs there. The release immediately
BELOW each floor goes in too, because a floor nothing below it breaks is a floor
nobody measured -- `--sweep` keeps walking down until something fails, which is
what turns the number into one.

**WRITTEN AFTER A RELEASE PROVED IT WAS NEEDED.** `arbiter-engine` 0.1.14 widened
the decline vocabulary, and a sibling bridge that pins it by range went from a
clean corpus to exit 2 on every release in its own range -- found by that
package's sweep, in CI, rather than by a consumer. This package pins the same
engine and had no such leg. Ported from `filing-balance-audit`, whose version
carries the reasoning in the comments below; the argument is not re-derived here.

    python3 battery/probe_pin.py
    python3 battery/probe_pin.py --sweep          # keep going below the floor
    python3 battery/probe_pin.py --keep           # leave the environments behind

Exit 0 every in-range release passed, 1 a declared claim is false, 2 the probe
could not run -- INCLUDING when a range holds no releases at all. *Every release
passed* is true of an empty set and means nothing, so an empty range is a failure
to measure and not a pass.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DECIDE: whether a passing below-floor release means the floor
should drop. The pin is true either way. `floor-not-demonstrated` says only that
this probe is not where the number came from, and lowering it needs a reason a
person supplies.
