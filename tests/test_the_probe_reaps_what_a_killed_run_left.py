"""What the pin probe removes on its way in, and what it must not.

Every run of this probe builds one virtualenv per release in range. The `finally`
that removes them covers exceptions and nothing else -- not SIGKILL, not a
timed-out CI step, not a reboot -- so a run killed that way leaves gigabytes
behind with nothing alive to clean up after it. `reap_abandoned` closes that on
the way in, because the run that leaked is not around to do it on the way out.

A tool that deletes directories it did not create in this process needs its
refusals tested harder than its removals, and that is most of what is here.
